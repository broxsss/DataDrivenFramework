DataDrivenFramework using Selenium to automate http://automationpractice.com/index.php Website

Here I have used only one driver i.e chrome driver because here i want to show more about DataDrivenFramework

To check how to run with different browser check my seleniumExample repo.

And

Here i have not used log4j, screenshot and custom report, if any body want to know more about them how to use them or integrate in project check  my Keyworddrivenframework repo.

I will add them in this project also ASAP.
